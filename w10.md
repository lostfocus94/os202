# TOP 10 LIST OF WEEK 10

### 1.A non-maskable interrupt (NMI) is a type of hardware interrupt (or signal to the processor) that prioritizes a certain thread or process. To learn about non-maskable interrupt, you can read it [at this website](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/11985/non-maskable-interrupt-nmi).
### 2. According to wikipedia processors typically have an internal interrupt mask register which allows selective enabling and disabling of hardware interrupts. To mask an interrupt is to disable it, while to unmask an interrupt is to enable it. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i94c5ofEHYE) to learn more about maskable interrupt.
### 3. What is the difference between non-maskable interrupt and maskable interrupt? You can find out by visiting [this website](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-maskable-and-non-maskable-interrupt/) or watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdmjLVeae_Y).
### 4. The Platform Controller Hub (PCH) is a family of Intel microchips employed in redesigned Intel Hub Architecture chipsets. Check [this website](https://itvarnews.techplusmedia.com/2018/07/13/intel-platform-controller-hub/) or [this website](https://enacademic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/10169522) to learn more about PCH. 
### 5. Peripheral Component Interconnect express (PCIe) is an interface standard for connecting high-speed components. Learn about PCIe [in this website](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/pcie-definition,5754.html).

### 6. What is the difference between SDRAM, DDR1, DDR2, DDR3 and DDR4? Visit [this website](https://www.transcend-info.com/Support/FAQ-296) to learn more.
### 7. In computing Live Media Interface (DMI) is Intel's link between the northbridge and southbridge on the computer's motherboard. To learn about DMI, you can visit [this website](https://yourdirectinfo.blogspot.com/2018/06/direct-media-interface.html).
### 8. SMBus is the System Management Bus defined by IntelÂ® Corporation in 1995.  It is used in personal computers and servers for low-speed system management communications. To learn about SMBus, you can visit [this website](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/smbus.htm) or [this website](http://smbus.org/).
### 9. Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is an interface bus commonly used to send data between microcontrollers and small peripherals such as shift registers, sensors, and SD cards. Visit [this website](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/serial-peripheral-interface-spi) to learn more about SPI.
### 10. Serial ATA (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment) is an IDE standard first released in 2001 for connecting devices like optical drives and hard drives to the motherboard. You can visit [this website](https://www.lifewire.com/serial-ata-sata-2626009) to learn more about SATA.
