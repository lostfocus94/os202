# TOP 10 LIST OF WEEK 3

### 1. A file is an object on a computer that stores data, information, settings, or commands used with a computer program. In a GUI (graphical user interface), such as Microsoft Windows, files display as icons that relate to the program that opens the file. For more information, you can check it [at this website](https://www.faceprep.in/operating-systems/operating-systems-concept-of-files/).
### 2. File sharing is a multipurpose computer service feature that evolved from removable media via network protocols, such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP). To learn more about file sharing you can visit [this website](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/16256/file-sharing).
### 3. When information is stored in a computer system, we want to keep it safe from physical damage (reliability) and improper access (protection). Protection can be provided in many ways. Check [this website](https://padakuu.com/article/78-file-protection) to learn more about file protection.
### 4. If you are new to the Linux command line, you may find yourself wondering why there are so many unusual directories. It turns out there's a method to this madness based on decades of UNIX convention, and [in this article](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/filesystem-hierarchy-standard), there's an introduction to the Linux directory structure.
### 5. What is a file control block? In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70nvqpeY6l8) there's a brief explanation about file control block. If that's not enough, you can also visit [this website](https://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-file-control-block.htm) for another explanation.

### 6. From the point of view of object-oriented programming, the kernel treats the generic filesystem as an abstract interface, and the big-three functions(open(), read() and write()) are "virtual," with no default definition. Accordingly, the kernel's default filesystem implementation is called a virtual filesystem (VFS). To learn more, you can visit [this website](https://opensource.com/article/19/3/virtual-filesystems-linux).
### 7. The directory implementation algorithms are classified according to the data structure they are using. There are mainly two algorithms that are used in these days, which is linear list and hash table. To learn the difference between those two algorithm, you can visit [this website](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-directory-implementation)  for more information.
### 8. The allocation methods define how the files are stored in the disk blocks. There are three main disk space or file allocation methods, (1) Contiguous Allocation, (2)Linked Allocation and (3)Indexed Allocation. There's advantages and disadvantages for each method, to learn more you can visit [this website](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-allocation-methods/).
### 9. According to wikipedia, disk partitioning or disk slicing is the creation of one or more regions on secondary storage, so that each region can be managed separately. These regions are called partitions. Learn [at this website](https://www.tecmint.com/create-disk-partitions-in-linux/) on how to do disk partitioning on linux operating system.
### 10. FUSE is a userspace interface for developing file systems. FUSE started out on Linux, but is now available on other platforms as well. Check [this playlist](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2303065?ln=en) to learn more about the evolution of FUSE. After that, you can also watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZn2_j_LbRY) to learn to make a simple FUSE using C on linux operating system.
