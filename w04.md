# TOP 10 LIST OF WEEK 4

### 1. Address uniquely identifies a location in the memory. We have two types of addresses that are logical address and physical address. To learn the difference between the two of them, you can check it [at this website](https://techdifferences.com/difference-between-logical-and-physical-address.html).
### 2. According to wikipedia page table is the data structure used by a virtual memory system in a computer operating system to store the mapping between virtual addresses and physical addresses. To learn more about page table you can visit [this website](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-page-table).
### 3. Memory management is the functionality of an operating system which handles or manages primary memory and moves processes back and forth between main memory and disk during execution. Check [this website](https://www.guru99.com/os-memory-management.html) to learn more about memory management.
### 4. According to information on wikipedia in computer storage, fragmentation is a phenomenon in which storage space is used inefficiently, reducing capacity or performance and often both. Learn about the difference between internal and external fragmentation [in this article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-internal-and-external-fragmentation/).
### 5. In computer architecture, 8-bit integers, memory addresses or other data units are those that are 8 bits (1 octet) wide. How much space does an 8-bit integer really occupy in C and Haskell? Learn more in [this website](https://ro-che.info/articles/2017-01-25-word8-space).

### 6. According to wikipedia endianness is the order or sequence of bytes of a word of digital data in computer memory. Endianness is primarily expressed as big-endian (BE) or little-endian (LE). To learn the difference between BE and LE, you can visit [this website](https://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-big-and-little-endian-byte-order/).
### 7. Libraries employ a software design also known as "shared components" or "archive libraries", which groups together multiple compiled object code files into a single file known as a library. Visit [this tutorial](http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LibraryArchives-StaticAndDynamic.html) to learn how to generate static, shared dynamic and loadable linux libraries.
### 8. What is a pointer in programming languange? Visit [this tutorial](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-pointers) to learn more about pointer in C languange.
### 9. How do you use array and pointer in C languange? How does these two relate to each other? Learn [at tutorial](https://www.learn-c.org/en/Arrays_and_Pointers) about array and pointer in C languange.
### 10. The actual layout of a program's in-memory image is left entirely up to the operating system. [This article](https://cs-fundamentals.com/c-programming/memory-layout-of-c-program-code-data-segments.php) explain about memory layout of C program code data segment. If you need more, check [this website](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/245665/understanding-how-variable-assignment-works) to learn other proffesional's insight on how variable assignment works.
