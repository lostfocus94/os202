# TOP 10 LIST OF WEEK 8

### 1. A typical process involves both I/O time and CPU time. In multi programming systems one process can use CPU while another is waiting for I/O, this is possible only with process scheduling. To learn about the scheduling in operating system, you can read it [at this website](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpu-scheduling-in-operating-systems/).
### 2. CPU burst is the amount of time the process uses the processor before it is no longer ready. Meanwhile I/O burst is the time that a process spends in waiting for the completion of the I/O request. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVzb3TUcDLo) to learn more about CPU dan IO burst.
### 3. First Come First Served (FCFS) and Longest Job First (LJF) is two of many burst algorithms. To learn about the difference between FCFS and LJF burst algorithms, you can visit [this website](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-first-come-first-served-fcfs-and-longest-job-first-ljf-cpu-scheduling-algorithms/?ref=rp). For more, [this website](http://cpuburst.com/) provide an interactive demonstration of CPU burst calculation.
### 4. Thread scheduling is the execution of multiple threads on a single CPU in some order. Check [this website](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/thread-scheduling/) to learn about thread scheduling.
### 5. According to wikipedia, the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) is a process scheduler which handles CPU resource allocation for executing processes, and aims to maximize overall CPU utilization while also maximizing interactive performance. Learn about completely fair scheduling [in this website](https://opensource.com/article/19/2/fair-scheduling-linux).

### 6. In real-time systems, the scheduler is considered as the most important component which is typically a short-term task scheduler. Visit [this website](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scheduling-in-real-time-systems/) to learn more about real time scheduling.
### 7. A long-requested feature, the ability in Linux to bind one or more processes to one or more processors is called CPU affinity. To learn about CPU affinity, you can visit [this website](https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6799).
### 8. Load balancing methods are also known as algorithms for load balancing or scheduling methods as they specify the manner in which a server load is shared across a server pool. Visit [this website](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/31290/load-balancing-methods) to learn more.
### 9. When a process executes, it goes through a number of states. The state of a process may change due to events like I/O requests, interrupt routines, synchronization of processes, process scheduling algorithms, etc. Visit [this website](https://slaystudy.com/process-state-models-in-operating-system/) to learn more about process state model.
### 10. Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a project that provides you with the steps necessary to build your own custom Linux system. You can visit [this website](https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=lfs) to learn brief information about LFS, or if you want full information you can also visit [LFS's website](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/). After that, you can watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmWz9Lkd0Kw&list=PLyc5xVO2uDsDesyjGMJSkVYEuiCH3D2TO) to follow a series of tutorials on how to build LFS.
