# TOP 10 LIST OF WEEK 6

### 1. According to wikipedia, a process is the instance of a computer program that is being executed by one or many threads. It contains the program code and its activity. Depending on the operating system (OS), a process may be made up of multiple threads of execution that execute instructions concurrently. To learn about the concept of process you can read it [at this website](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_processes.htm) or watch the explanation in [this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTTSbI7Rm8o).
### 2. The act of determining which process is in the ready state, and should be moved to the running state is known as process scheduling. Visit [this website](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/process-scheduling) to learn more about process scheduling. If that's not enough, you can also get another explanation in [this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THqcAa1bbFU).
### 3. There are two kinds of scheduling methods, which are preemptive scheduling and non-preemptive scheduling. To learn about the difference between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling, you can visit [this website](https://www.guru99.com/cpu-scheduling-algorithms.html) and/or watch [this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFnrUVqtiOY).
### 4. When a C program is created it's just some pieces of bytes which is stored in hard disk. And when the program started, it's going to  be load in memory and become a live entity. Check [this website](https://www.includehelp.com/operating-systems/memory-layout-of-a-process.aspx) to learn the memory layout of a process.
### 5. According to wikipedia, a process control block (PCB) is a data structure used by computer operating systems to store all the information about a process. Learn about PCB [in this website](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/operating-system6.htm), or you can also watch [this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4s2MKuVYKV8)

### 6. What is a Thread? A thread is a path of execution within a process. Visit [this website](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/thread-in-operating-system/) to learn more about thread.
### 7. According to wikipedia multithreading is the ability of a central processing unit (CPU) (or a single core in a multi-core processor) to provide multiple threads of execution concurrently, supported by the operating system. To learn about multithreading, you can visit [this website](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multithreading-in-operating-system/). After that, you can visit [this website](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multithreading-c-2/) to learn the example of multithreading in C languange.
### 8. What's the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing? Visit [this website](https://www.guru99.com/difference-between-multiprocessing-and-multithreading.html) to learn more.
### 9. A thread library provides the programmer an API for creating and managing threads. Visit [this website](https://padakuu.com/article/101-thread-libraries) to learn more about thread library.
### 10. Concurrency is the computation of processes within a time frame to give an impression of simultaneous execution. Here, it's important to note that this is not the same thing as actually running simultaneously. You can watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKtvNJQoCNw) or [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDX20TPtoVk) to learn more about concurrencya.
