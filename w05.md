# TOP 10 LIST OF WEEK 5

### 1. Logical address is address generated by CPU during execution whereas Physical Address refers to location in memory unit(the one that is loaded into memory). To learn how operating system map virtual addresses to physical addresses you can read it [at this website](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mapping-virtual-addresses-to-physical-addresses/).
### 2. According to wikipedia demand paging (as opposed to anticipatory paging) is a method of virtual memory management. Visit [this website](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-demand-paging) to learn more about demand paging.
### 3. According to wikipedia a page fault is a type of exception raised by computer hardware when a running program accesses a memory page that is not currently mapped by the memory management unit (MMU) into the virtual address space of a process. To learn more about page fault you can visit [this website](https://scoutapm.com/blog/understanding-page-faults-and-memory-swap-in-outs-when-should-you-worry).
### 4. What is the performance of demand paging? Check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5fH9Y_dG_o) to learn more about demand paging performance. After that you can visit [this website](https://examradar.com/performance-calculation-demand-paging-system/) to learn to do performance calcultaion of demand paging.
### 5. One of Copy On Write (COW) main use is in the implementation of the fork system call in which it shares the virtual memory(pages) of the OS. Learn about COW [in this website](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/copy-on-write/).

### 6. In an operating system that uses paging for memory management, a page replacement algorithm is needed to decide which page needs to be replaced when new page comes in. Visit [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-systems/) to learn more about page replacement algorithm. There are different page replacement algorithms which suggest different ways to decide which page to replace, there's [FIFO](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-page-replacement-algorithms-set-2-fifo/), [LRU](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-least-recently-used-lru-page-replacement-algorithm/) and [Optimal Page Replacement](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/optimal-page-replacement-algorithm/). Of course each algorithm offers different advantages and disadvantages, you can learn more about that [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-various-page-replacement-algorithms/)
### 7. Frame allocation algorithms are used if you have multiple processes, it helps decide how many frames to allocate to each process. To learn about allocation of frames, you can visit [this website](https://basicittopic.com/allocation-of-frames/). If that's not enough, you can also watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5i-IAuYO6g) for more explanation.
### 8. We can classify page-replacement algorithms into two broad categories, global replacement and local replacement. Visit [this website](https://codescracker.com/operating-system/local-versus-global-allocation-policies.htm) to learn different policies between local and global allocation. For more explanation you can also watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAZSOh77VT4).
### 9. In the past processors had been designed as Symmetric Multi-processing or Uniform Memory Architecture (UMA) machines, but this era of data centric processing gave birth to a new architecture called Non-uniform memory access (NUMA). Visit [this website](http://www.techplayon.com/what-is-numa-non-uniform-memory-access/) to learn more about NUMA.
### 10. The top command allows users to monitor processes and system resource usage on Linux. Visit [this guide](https://www.booleanworld.com/guide-linux-top-command/) to understand and be able to use top command on Linux.
